Mania is a game about struggling/fighting to reach someone that is far, and how that experience feels.

I think I like the idea that different moods of the character would change the gameplay. And I know how they would affect the story, or get affected by it as well. But how would the moods actually affect the gameplay? It's too simple to change the stats of the main character. 

- It should alter the world somehow! When you're Angry, you don't see some things that exist in the world, and start seeing others. You can choose to add to your anger fuel, or calm down (more difficult).
