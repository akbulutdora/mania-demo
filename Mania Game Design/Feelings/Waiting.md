> In the past week, I opened myself to my mom in slight disbelief that it will be of any help. We've been talking bit by bit for several days. About my relationship, about love, about careers, and how these might end up in a life full of "what if"s. From that talk, one obvious thing stuck with me. She told me that everybody wants to be loved and missed.

> In the game, I want to convey the idea of waiting and loneliness. And I know that Mana talks about waiting in a different sense. She never waited like this. When I am waiting like this, always on touching distance from love and affection but never getting it, I'm in a state where I don't want to do anything. As if she might write or call any minute, I am postponing anything that I might do.

> I don't know what depression is, but this is my closest guess. I wake up, do not leave the bed for an hour, then have breakfast and have a short, slightly (like everything) forced chat with my mom, then play games, then think about the weather or look outside. It takes me a few hours to decide to watch something or do something else, and everything either can be postponed or is unlikely to happen so I end up wasting time, waiting. Because she might write or call, and maybe we talk.

How to put this feeling into the game?

The easiest way is to write it and show it to the player. But how to bake it into the gameplay?

An episode where the player can't go far from a certain point. When they do, they get damaged ([[No HP]]). Going back is easier. And waiting there heals the player in ticks until a certain time. Staying too long also has damaging affects.
